	<h2>The Excellent Path of Devotion</h2>
<h3>An Abridged Story of a Mendicantâs Experiences in Response to Questions from Vajra Kin<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></h3>
<p><strong><em>by Sera Khandro</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Eh ma ho!<br/>
In the pure realm of the dharmakÄya, you are the teacher Samantabhadra.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a><br/>
In the pure realm of the sambhogakÄya, you are Vairochana of the five buddha families.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a><br/>
You are the nirmÄá¹akÄya Padmasambhava, Lord of Three Protectors.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a><br/>
I pray to Pema Ledrel, the lord on the crown of my head, dharma master, and guide of disciples.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a><br/>
Having ripened and freed my mind, may you abide as the Lord of Families on my crown chakra of great bliss and completely bestow the blessing of supremely sharp intelligence!</em></p>
<p>As clearly predicted in the vajra prophecies,<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a><br/>
the dharmakÄya SamantabhadrÄ«, the sambhogakÄya VajravÄrÄhÄ«,<br/>
and the nirmÄá¹akÄya Yeshe Tsogyal of Karchenâ<br/>
as well as her mind emanation of enlightened speech Dorje Shyiwa Tso<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a>â<br/>
are all my illusory emanations from several past lives.<br/>
Yet, I remain a simple woman<br/>
with little knowledge and an ordinary form.<br/>
Lacking even minor qualities from study, concentration, and meditation,<br/>
I am tormented constantly by forces of laziness and distraction.<br/>
For an unworthy person like myself to write a profound tale<br/>
about the arising of excellent teachings and noble qualities<br/>
can be likened to sky-lotusesâeveryone knows they donât exist.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a><br/>
Nevertheless, two close vajra siblings<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> earnestly requested me to write this;<br/>
and in order not to disappoint them,<br/>
I explain here a small factual description of my present birth,<br/>
which has come about through previously accumulated merit.<br/>
May the assembly of space-dwelling á¸ÄkinÄ«s grant me their permission!<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> </p>
<p>Long ago, at the feet of the Buddha, I was known as Utpalma,<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a><br/>
In the land of India, I was Rolang Derol;<br/>
and in the presence of Padmasambhava, I was Dorje Shyiwa Tso.<br/>
In Khotan,<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> I was the Nepalese lady Changchub DrÃ¶n.<br/>
Then, after many rebirths,<br/>
I was born as Kunzang Dekyong ChÃ¶nyi Wangmo in Lhasa, Tibet<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a><br/>
to a family of imperial rank who were noble and rich.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a><br/>
From the time I was young, I loved the dharma<br/>
and yearned to awaken for the sake of all beings.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a><br/>
Having seen that the eight worldly concerns were meaningless,<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a><br/>
I constantly prayed to the Triple Gem.<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a><br/>
Due to such aspirations: when I turned eight,<br/>
the á¸ÄkinÄ«s blessed me, took care of me,<br/>
and protected me as their own cherished daughter.<br/>
Noble TÄrÄ,<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> appearing as a nun, accepted me as a disciple<br/>
and gave advice on arousing bodhichitta.<br/>
KungabÃ¼ma,<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> led me through the door of the dharma<br/>
by giving me refuge vows and so on<br/>
and showed me the path to liberation.<br/>
Though my parents were from a good family<br/>
with virtuous minds inclined toward the dharma,<br/>
they were influential in society and had an interest in power.<br/>
Therefore, for some years I led a life<br/>
that mingled both spiritual and worldly affairs,<br/>
while managing our subjects and servants.<br/>
It was my fatherâs command that I marry,<br/>
and this order brought me great torment and despair.<br/>
Resolved to avoid this, I prayed to Padmasambhava,<br/>
Yeshe Tsogyal, and the space-dwelling á¸Äkas and á¸ÄkinÄ«s;<br/>
and by the strength of those supplications,<br/>
I was able to overcome this obstacle of saá¹sÄra.<br/>
When I was twelve, my positive karma blossomed<br/>
and Saraha<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a>, accepted me as his disciple.<br/>
He taught me the paths of ripening and liberation<br/>
and the pith instructions of the fourth chakra.<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a><br/>
He bestowed this transmission completely,<br/>
like giving his most cherished wealth.<br/>
Through [engaging in] this practice,<br/>
the obscurations of my channels and winds were reduced a little;<br/>
and I progressed in the six signs of entering, abiding, and inseparability.<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a><br/>
Magical displays of wisdom and worldly deities and demons<br/>
enhanced my realization, and I realized awareness-wisdom.<br/>
Knowing that the arising of the forms of deities and demons<br/>
were the appearances of my mind,<br/>
I didnât need to mentally fabricate a mask of realization.<br/>
For a while, I cared for these deities and demons as my own disciples. </p>
<p>When I was thirteen,<br/>
due to the potency of previously accumulated prayers,<br/>
I met the powerful Siddha Kukupa.<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a><br/>
He introduced me to the pith instructions<br/>
on dispelling obscurations in the channels and winds.<br/>
Using the five chakras as a support,<br/>
he taught the stages of the path of outer and inner mahÄmudrÄ<br/>
and the secret teachings.<br/>
Through the power of releasing the knots of my heart channel,<br/>
the wisdom beings gave me unmistaken symbolic scrolls;<br/>
and I actually beheld the faces of Padmasambhava and Yeshe Tsogyal.<br/>
I was empowered as an emissary of these wisdom beings,<br/>
who prophesied that the time was ripe to benefit others<br/>
and gave advice on how to gradually accomplish the two purposes:<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the direction of Khamâthe land of cannibalsâ<br/>
your consorts, dharma holders, and disciples reside.<br/>
You will guide them humbly and skillfully in the three lands. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus they gave many prophecies and advice,<br/>
And I received transmissions of both secret treasuries of the dÄkinÄ«s.<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a><br/>
They gave the symbolic scrolls,<br/>
which foretold present and future occurrences.<br/>
They said that in the future,<br/>
I would have the power to lead those connected to me<br/>
to the realm of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s, a self-appearing pure land;<br/>
and they entrusted me with these decrees in writing.<br/>
YudrÃ¶nma helped me directly by writing down<br/>
the á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ indications of what would happen.<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[26]</a><br/>
In particular, she taught me the methods<br/>
of examining consorts from the five classes<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[27]</a><br/>
and the activities of magnetizing, training, and ripening.<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[28]</a><br/>
Having presented me texts with the symbolic communications<br/>
of the vidyÄdharas,<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[29]</a> Orgyen of the Copper Island,<a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[30]</a><br/>
and the á¸ÄkinÄ«s, she gave oral instructions<br/>
with predictions concerning the present and future.<br/>
Based on these, I was able to benefit formless gods and demons.<br/>
The protectors and local spirits of Tibet,<br/>
such as Nyenchen<a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[31]</a> and others, created favorable conditions;<br/>
and even though they handed me several treasures,<br/>
I concealed them once again for the [future] well-being of Tibet.</p>
<p>At this time, one nun who was believed to be KungabÃ¼ma said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you know the meaning of emptiness?<br/>
If you do not realize the meaning of emptinessâ<br/>
even if you are inspired to speak and act virtuouslyâ<br/>
benefits will be insignificant.<br/>
Tied to everything by the tight bonds of self-cherishing,<br/>
you will spend your life juggling both virtue and vice.<br/>
The results of this are rebirth in the three higher states,<br/>
as well as in the lower realms,<br/>
and revolving among them while remaining within the limits of saá¹sÄra.<br/>
Hence, donât be blind to your own wisdom.<br/>
Knowing what to accept and reject,<br/>
sustain the practice of this self-abiding wisdomâ<br/>
the great secret of the mind.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Principal among the three-kÄya á¸ÄkinÄ«s, VarÄhÄ«â<br/>
yoginÄ« of the magical wisdom danceâ<br/>
I pray to you with irreversible devotion.<br/>
Please show me the secret of my mind.<br/>
Bestow your blessings, Noble Lady, so I can become like you,<br/>
rather than remain in saá¹sÄra in this life.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Goddess spoke: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Eh ma ho!<br/>
Listen, pure Fortunate One,<br/>
to this explanation of the oral instructions on the secret of mind.<br/>
First, rest your body, speech, and mind at ease;<br/>
the key points of the body are the seven points of Vairochana.<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[32]</a><br/>
The key point of speech is to stop talking,<br/>
like the strings of a vina<a href="#fn:33" id="fnref:33" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[33]</a> breaking.<br/>
Donât attempt to speak.<br/>
Rest your voice and breath in their own places.<br/>
The key point of mind is to rest<br/>
 in an uncontrived, clear, and empty state.<br/>
The mindâs nature is emptyâ<br/>
the dharmakÄya, free from elaboration.<br/>
Its clear-light aspect is sambhogakÄya,<br/>
unobstructed self-luminosity.<br/>
Its radiation and reabsorption, the appearances of whatever arises,<br/>
is nirmÄá¹akÄya.<br/>
Awareness, inseparable from the three kÄyas,<br/>
is perfected in the ground.<br/>
For those of sharpest faculties<br/>
who can understand self-appearances as awareness,<br/>
these essential oral instructions are supremely profound.<br/>
Those of intermediate faculties, whose minds rely on objects,<br/>
need the oral instructions on destroying the house of dualistic fixation<br/>
through discerning saá¹sÄra and enlightenment with body, speech, and mind<br/>
and through the mindâs arising, abiding, and so forth.<a href="#fn:34" id="fnref:34" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[34]</a><br/>
You must take my adviceâthese profound oral instructionsâ<br/>
to heart without being lazy like a child<br/>
or allowing them to dissipate.<br/>
The view of emptiness is nothing more than this.<br/>
The awareness of the three kÄyas is this itself.<br/>
Great self-originating wisdom is this.<br/>
Even if you search the entire three-thousandfold universe,<br/>
you wonât find a higher secret of mind.<br/>
Because your mind is actually the perfected buddha,<br/>
do not search elsewhere for some other so-called buddha.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then she disappeared like a rainbow into the sky. </p>
<p>I resolved to exert myself in practice until my death<br/>
according to this á¸ÄkinÄ«âs advice.<br/>
From the time I was fourteen until I was eighteen:<br/>
in order to accomplish the dharma,<br/>
I engaged in many physical and verbal austerities.<br/>
Even though I did not eat a morsel of food for almost one month,<br/>
I did nothing that was not dharma.<br/>
From the time I was young, I had placed my trust in the lama,<br/>
the Triple Gem, and the wisdom deities;<br/>
so no matter what unbearable suffering occurred,<br/>
I considered it all to be the result of my previously accumulated karma.<br/>
I felt that if I could not accomplish the sublime dharma in my present life,<br/>
then I would be without any means to repay the great kindness<br/>
of all sentient beings in general and in particular of my parents.<br/>
Thinking that way â with great effort from the depth of my heart,<br/>
I abandoned my homeland, which had become like a land of cannibals,<br/>
and I was propelled by the force of my previous aspirations<br/>
and karmic fortune to the eastern land of Amdo-Golok.<a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[35]</a> </p>
<p>Because of my lowly status and state of poverty,<br/>
I was reviled and abused by practically everyone.<br/>
Soâalthough I had the capacity to reveal profound earth treasures<a href="#fn:36" id="fnref:36" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[36]</a>â<br/>
due to not having the appropriate companions,<br/>
dharma holders, and the like, this didnât happen.<a href="#fn:37" id="fnref:37" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[37]</a><br/>
When tormented by many negative circumstances,<br/>
I offered a gaá¹achakra<a href="#fn:38" id="fnref:38" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[38]</a> to the maá¹á¸ala of space-activity á¸ÄkinÄ«s<br/>
and invoked them with this prayer: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Alas! O Wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s â<br/>
 please do not rest your compassion in the expanse of peace.<br/>
Look upon this unfortunate girl with loving-kindness.<br/>
Although I have acted in accord with the á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ instructions,<br/>
it is difficult for me to benefit the teachings and beings.<br/>
In these degenerate times,<br/>
 people are deceived by wrong views and demons;<br/>
and those who practice in accord with dharma<br/>
are as rare as daytime stars.<br/>
People regard food that has been obtained from harmful<br/>
religious offerings and wrong livelihoods as medicine.<br/>
They cunningly deceive others, thinking this will not affect them.<br/>
Taking food given in faith by the living,<br/>
accruing the debts of the dead,<a href="#fn:39" id="fnref:39" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[39]</a><br/>
and disregarding the law of cause and effect,<br/>
such people engage in all kinds of negativity.<br/>
When such obvious signs of these degenerate times appear,<br/>
how can someone like me<br/>
help end the decline of the doctrine and beings?<br/>
These pigheaded people full of wrong views<br/>
show anger when confronted with kindness.<br/>
They say people who act harmoniously with the dharma are foolish.<br/>
Even though, in accord with the teachings of the Buddha,<br/>
I cherished them more than myself<br/>
and donned a suit of patienceâ<br/>
viewing good and bad with one tasteâ<br/>
they said I was a bad person,<br/>
like a dog that doesnât understand good and evil.<br/>
These many judgments and criticisms,<br/>
resulted in everyone thinking I lacked noble qualities.<br/>
Being the target of such abuse, slander, and wrong views â<br/>
forget about benefitting othersâ<br/>
I have been the cause of everyoneâs ruin!<br/>
Therefore, may I discard my unworthy body<br/>
and be reborn as a male with the freedom to practice dharma.<a href="#fn:40" id="fnref:40" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[40]</a><br/>
And yet still I will endeavor to fulfill the aspirations<br/>
of the guru and consort and to benefit the doctrine and beings<br/>
in line with the á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ instructions.<br/>
Please listen to me now,<br/>
you who reside in the wisdom expanse!</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the force of my intense wailing and cries to them,<br/>
the emanations of space arose as ornaments of the expanse.<br/>
The great mother of the expanse, the all-illuminating queen of space,<br/>
revealed these words in the secret signs of the space-appearing á¸ÄkinÄ«s: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Eh eh ya!<br/>
The luminosity of the jewel of the eastern sky<br/>
impartially dispels the darkness of beings.<br/>
How can a view of good or bad then be possible<br/>
regarding the body of a messenger of the mother á¸ÄkinÄ«s?<br/>
Everything depends on your disciples and their karmic aspirations.<br/>
Donât let your heart become weary, sad, or discouraged.<br/>
From the time you were eight until fourteen:<br/>
due to the strength of your previous prayers to the Lotus Born,<br/>
you were able to benefit gods and demons a little bit.<br/>
There is no reason to be proud, as this was your previous karma.<br/>
From age fifteen until twenty,<br/>
you will experience unendurable suffering.<br/>
Donât become disheartened;<br/>
it will be the end of this karma.
From age twenty-one until twenty-eight,<br/>
due to corrupt conditions surrounding your disciples,<br/>
your negative connections with people<br/>
will be more than your positive ones.<br/>
Nonetheless, by diligently supplicating Padmasambhava<br/>
 and Yeshe Tsogyal without any hesitation,<br/>
you will encounter your destined treasure companions<br/>
and karmic dharma holders.<br/>
From then on, gradually,<br/>
your ability to benefit the doctrine and beings will increase,<br/>
and steadily, your negative connections<br/>
will decrease in comparison with good ones.<br/>
Once againâwhether the people with whom<br/>
you are connected are good or badâ<br/>
since they are still your disciples to tame,<br/>
you must rid yourself of likes and dislikes, joy and sorrow.<br/>
Your view of equanimity must be steadfast.<br/>
For those who are emissaries of the mother á¸ÄkinÄ«s,<br/>
everything depends on auspicious connections.<br/>
It is important to be careful and act skillfully.<br/>
Whether you become a treasure revealer or not<br/>
depends on you yourself.<br/>
If you do not carry out the instructions of the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s:<br/>
even though you have a mandate to discover treasures,<br/>
this could be obstructed by negative events;<br/>
and you could bring unwanted results upon yourself.<br/>
Although you have treasure authorization,<br/>
other circumstances could overpower you.<br/>
You could become a householderâs wife by falling in love,<br/>
thereby losing your spiritual aims;<br/>
and then your treasure activities would be hidden.<br/>
If you engage in this kind of conduct, it will be such a shame.<br/>
Whereas if you fulfill the á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ commands,<br/>
you will surely benefit yourself and others.<br/>
Do you understand these prophecies, young lady of noble family?<br/>
I, a manifestation of space, dissolve back into space!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then she vanished into space as light.<br/>
From the time I was nineteen until I was twenty-eight,<br/>
my experiences of joy and sorrow fluctuated like ripples on water.<br/>
Half of what occurred was for the sake of the dharma;<br/>
the rest was worldly suffering.<br/>
In particular, by the command of a lama<br/>
 from whom I had received empowerments,<br/>
I got married and exerted myself in worldly activities.<a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[41]</a><br/>
But I was never able to make anyone happy.<br/>
Upset by these situations, I despaired of saá¹sÄra. </p>
<p>Once, when I was considering departing<br/>
to the realm of the invisible glorious mountain,<br/>
two beautiful girls from a nonhuman land appeared.<br/>
Adorned with many precious jewels, they spoke sweetly: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Eh ma, listen friend, do you know us two?<br/>
We are fine á¸ÄkinÄ«s from a hidden pure realm<br/>
with worthy advice for you.<br/>
Lady, is it good for you to depart<br/>
for the blissful citadel of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s?<br/>
In degenerate times, arenât the minds of beings<br/>
controlled by demonic forces?<br/>
Donât fight with your companion.<br/>
The harm of samaya breakage will affect you, donât you know?<a href="#fn:42" id="fnref:42" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[42]</a><br/>
The lady named Pal<a href="#fn:43" id="fnref:43" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[43]</a>,<br/>
will be your reminder to practice virtue.<br/>
In order to give up attachment or aversion to that situation,<br/>
isnât it best to just let things be?<br/>
When the dragon adorns her crown<br/>
with [one born in the] Iron Snake [Year] from the south,<a href="#fn:44" id="fnref:44" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[44]</a><br/>
you will soon receive the precious jewel.<br/>
Isnât that the accomplishment of the twofold purpose?<br/>
Now is not the time for you to come to our place.<br/>
Through the encouragement<br/>
of the sublime being born in the Year of the Horse,<a href="#fn:45" id="fnref:45" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[45]</a><br/>
beneficial conditions will fall into place for this one named Vajra.<a href="#fn:46" id="fnref:46" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[46]</a><br/>
Do you understand this?<br/>
For three years and three months, donât see anyone.<br/>
If you are diligent in practicing:<br/>
on the unmistaken special occasion of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s on Saga Dawa,<br/>
he will dispel [your obstacles], donât you know?<a href="#fn:47" id="fnref:47" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[47]</a><br/>
Whatever actions you do,<br/>
if you practice perfectly according to the á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ prophecies,<br/>
you will attain the banner of the two treasure lineages,<br/>
donât you know?<a href="#fn:48" id="fnref:48" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[48]</a><br/>
We will come and give you future prophecies from time to time.<br/>
Do not share these with others;<br/>
they are sealed in secrecy.<br/>
Conceal them in the expanse of your heart.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then they dissolved like rainbows into the expanse of the sky.<br/>
Following that, I became a bit ill. </p>
<p>Then, an actual emanation of the great treasure revealer Karma Lingpa,<br/>
Jigdrel ChÃ¶kyi LodrÃ¶ Rinpoche<a href="#fn:49" id="fnref:49" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[49]</a>, pursued me,<br/>
although knowing [my circumstances].<br/>
He emphasized our strong dharma and samaya connections;<br/>
but because of the á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ advice,<br/>
there was no way I could comply.<br/>
Around that time, one monk dressed like a paá¹á¸ita<a href="#fn:50" id="fnref:50" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[50]</a><br/>
saying he was Guru Rinpoche<br/>
approached me while I was herding animals.<br/>
âDo you know me?â he asked three times. </p>
<p>I replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you are Guru Rinpoche,<br/>
you have omniscience of the three times.<br/>
Your activity is unfathomable,<br/>
 and your miracles are unimpeded.<br/>
Having achieved the supreme siddhi,<br/>
you are principal among all buddhas.<br/>
I respectfully bow to you, Unsurpassed Guru.<br/>
At the moment when the appearances of this life vanish,<br/>
may I and all those connected to me<br/>
immediately awaken in the original expanse of the dharmadhÄtu<br/>
inseparable with you, Noble Guru.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I said that, the monk responded: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I am a nirmÄá¹akÄya free from cause and circumstance,<br/>
spontaneously present and naturally arisen
for the benefit of sentient beings.<br/>
This monk has no purpose other than helping sentient beings.<br/>
I achieved the vajrakÄya, the supreme body that is formless.<br/>
Although ordinary beings are far removed<br/>
from directly seeing the Lotus Bornâ<br/>
if they invoke Guru Rinpoche<br/>
with the power of previous aspirations and faith,<br/>
such devoted ones will see my face, hear my speech,<br/>
and receive the blessings of my wisdom mind in the six times.<br/>
Since you are also endowed with fortunate karma,<br/>
you have met me;<br/>
but because you have forsaken your consort<br/>
and harbor doubt toward Mantra,<br/>
you see me as a common monk.<br/>
If you wish to harness the treasures that belong to you,<br/>
near here in the direction of the southern sun<br/>
is a treasure revealer who is other than myself,<br/>
although inseparable from me.<br/>
From the vajra family, this bodhisattvaâs name is RaÅmi<a href="#fn:51" id="fnref:51" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[51]</a>,<br/>
If you unite with this hero,<br/>
then from the south and to the south,<br/>
the two foretold treasure lineages will flourish.<a href="#fn:52" id="fnref:52" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[52]</a><br/>
If the black iron snake comes to the belly of the dragon,<a href="#fn:53" id="fnref:53" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[53]</a><br/>
from all directions a flock of golden birds will gather like clouds.<br/>
If the black crow does not rain poison,<br/>
for sixty years the barbarian wars will be prevented.<br/>
For a while, the sun of bliss and joy will dawn for Tibet.<br/>
It is crucial to take great care with the key points<br/>
of the prophetic guides to your own treasures,<br/>
like timing, signs, interdependencies, and the rest.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So he said; and due to that, my appearances were transformed,<br/>
and I arrived among the ranks of an assembly of wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ«s.<br/>
From the vina of their melodious speech like the <em>kalapingka</em> bird,<a href="#fn:54" id="fnref:54" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[54]</a><br/>
I received the intermediate á¸ÄkinÄ« scroll of my profound dharma treasures.<br/>
Immediately thereafter, VimaraÅmi accepted me as his disciple;<br/>
and from the western gate<br/>
of the second great snow mountain called Machen Pomra,<a href="#fn:55" id="fnref:55" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[55]</a><br/>
at the nearby sacred place of the seven wrathful ladies,<br/>
I revealed the profound treasure<br/>
of the <em>á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ Secret Treasury of Reality</em>.<a href="#fn:56" id="fnref:56" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[56]</a><br/>
Also, at the wish-accomplishing placesâthe stupa of Ashoka,<a href="#fn:57" id="fnref:57" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[57]</a><br/>
Luminous Blazing Iron Mountain,<br/>
the sacred place of Dong Dzong, Garuá¸a Cliff peak,<br/>
the High Lotus Mountain, the Monkey Fortress, and so onâ<br/>
from the major and minor sacred places,<br/>
I discovered some treasures that were intangible<br/>
and others that were material.<br/>
Each of these treasures included timely predictions.<br/>
However, due to corruption among my disciples,<br/>
the auspicious connections became obscured.<br/>
Nevertheless, timely and auspicious profound teachings<br/>
are similar to the emergence of a headwater<br/>
that cannot be blocked by earth.<br/>
Although negativity was swirling like the wind, I had no fear;<br/>
and I gradually encountered the fortunate ones who would hold my lineage.<br/>
I became capable of skillfully abandoning activities<br/>
of the eight worldly concerns.<br/>
From age twenty-nine until thirty-two [and]<br/>
based on temporary circumstances and the ripening of previous karma,<br/>
I was discarded by my companion like an unwanted dog.<a href="#fn:58" id="fnref:58" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[58]</a><br/>
Moved by my condition of intense and unbearable illness,<a href="#fn:59" id="fnref:59" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[59]</a><br/>
the Lord of Refugeâprotector on the crown of my head, Pema Ledrelâ<br/>
accepted me and bestowed his dharma treasury<br/>
of empowerments and teachings,<br/>
which uprooted the dark ignorance of my mind.<br/>
He then opened the secret treasury<br/>
 of the one-hundred gateways of wisdom knowledge,<br/>
and my mind was enriched with the wealth of study and contemplation.<br/>
In particular, I awakened directly into the inner meaning of wisdom,<br/>
and attained the path of liberationâs union of mahÄmudrÄ.<br/>
By the power of this, externally, my fame among disciples grew;<br/>
and internally, the knots of my central and throat channels were completely released.<br/>
Secretly, I actualized non-conceptual wisdom;<br/>
and I increasingly spread forth the doctrine<br/>
of the profound treasure teachings<br/>
through writing them down and propagating them.<br/>
Accomplishing the welfare of those to be tamed occurred effortlessly.<br/>
Assemblies of deities, á¸ÄkinÄ«s, dharmapÄlas,<br/>
 and treasure guardians accompanied me like my shadow,<br/>
ensuring positive circumstances.<br/>
Their manner of giving me prophecies and advice is shown in other texts.<a href="#fn:60" id="fnref:60" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[60]</a> </p>
<p>Once, after having been advised by the hero who benefits beings<a href="#fn:61" id="fnref:61" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[61]</a><br/>
when I was staying near White Crag,<br/>
four nonhuman females with the faces of a tiger, lion, bear, and parrot came before me.<br/>
In a single voice, they melodiously proclaimed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ha ya hi! Listen, Powerful YoginÄ«!<br/>
From the fortress of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s called Tidro,<br/>
the all-seeing wisdom lady<a href="#fn:62" id="fnref:62" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[62]</a> has sent a sublime message for you.<br/>
At the supreme placeâVajra Rock Fortressâ<br/>
in an assembly of vajra á¸ÄkinÄ«s,<br/>
the profound teachings of The Gathering of Wisdom Mind<br/>
and The Heart Essence of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s<a href="#fn:63" id="fnref:63" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[63]</a>,<br/>
will appear as your unchanging fortune<br/>
at the auspicious time and circumstances.<br/>
That time will be the Year of the Horse,<a href="#fn:64" id="fnref:64" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[64]</a><br/>
and then it is certain that distant guardians<br/>
will present to you your treasures.<br/>
Due to the profundity [of these treasures], great discord can arise;<br/>
so you must be extremely careful regarding that.<br/>
Through the panting roar of the earth,<br/>
it is possible that the luminous radiance<br/>
of the all-radiant sun maá¹á¸ala will diminish<br/>
as dark rain clouds are summoned.<br/>
At that time, be wise!<br/>
People who are influenced by demons<br/>
will invite you with pleasing words,<br/>
and various unwanted obstacles could occur.<br/>
If you follow the one named Ma,<a href="#fn:65" id="fnref:65" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[65]</a><br/>
who knows what the outcome might be?<br/>
At the appropriate future time,<br/>
the á¸ÄkinÄ«s will bring you clear prophecies explaining this.<br/>
Did you understand, dear friend?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I responded by asking âwho are you?â<br/>
I was not able to finish my question since I woke up due to other causes;<br/>
and the vision vanished of its own accord.<br/>
Nevertheless, according to the á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ prophecies,<br/>
I revealed the profound treasures,<br/>
clearly transcribed them, and distributed them to many.<br/>
During this time, a dark man wearing a white <em>chuba</em>,<br/>
who said he was the King of Gojo arrived.<a href="#fn:66" id="fnref:66" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[66]</a><br/>
In a loud frightening voice he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You, Strange Lady!<br/>
Why did you come to this place and where are you from?<br/>
Donât stay here or we will have a fight!</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus he snarled, curling his lips. </p>
<p>I responded: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You, Unfortunate One,<br/>
I have never seen a person as odd as you.<br/>
The Trom Valley is a passageway for all Tibetans and Chinese.<br/>
I didnât know that it belonged to you alone.<br/>
Whatever the case, I have neither home nor parents;<br/>
and alone, I wander wherever I please.<br/>
I cherish neither my body nor belongings,<br/>
but offer them as a feast to gods and demons<br/>
of confused karmic perceptions.<br/>
I forcefully strike down the ego-pride<br/>
of all form and formless beings.<br/>
I recognize everything that arises and appears<br/>
 as mindâs magical manifestation.<br/>
I uphold the instructions for destroying grasping<br/>
 to deluded perceptions and self-cherishing.<br/>
Due to chance, you have appeared in my view.<br/>
Yet free from benefit or harm,<br/>
 everything is the manifestation of the dharmakÄya<br/>
within the expanse of the wisdom intent<br/>
of the primordially liberated, unborn Great Mother. Phet!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having retorted like that, I relaxed momentarily<br/>
within great, empty awareness free from limitations,<br/>
the space of purity and evenness.<br/>
And like a dream,<br/>
that confused appearance faded into basic space. </p>
<p>Due to the negative effects of my inadequate merit<br/>
when I was thirty-three and thereafter,<br/>
the Lord of Refuge, all-knowing jewel of my heart, Pema Ledrel,<br/>
departed for the realm of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s.<a href="#fn:67" id="fnref:67" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[67]</a><br/>
Without my protector,<br/>
I was left behind lacking a home and partner.<br/>
I was even banished to a distant land<br/>
and became like a thorn, irritating everyoneâs eyes.<br/>
The heart son of the Lord of Refuge,<br/>
my vajra brother Natsok Rangdrol<a href="#fn:68" id="fnref:68" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[68]</a>, alone<br/>
consoled me by saying,<br/>
âYou, the supreme consort of His Highness,<br/>
must not exile yourself to a faraway place.â<br/>
He then bound me by our sacred dharma commitments.<br/>
Because of that, I stayed at the holy place<br/>
of Sera Monastery<a href="#fn:69" id="fnref:69" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[69]</a> for several years.<br/>
I held, protected, and spread the profound teachings<br/>
of both the great treasure revealer and his son<a href="#fn:70" id="fnref:70" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[70]</a><br/>
according to the command of the Lord of Refuge.<br/>
I propagated the profound treasures to everyone,<br/>
both near and far.<br/>
In particular, I entrusted the inheritance<br/>
 of the two treasures<a href="#fn:71" id="fnref:71" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[71]</a> to those fortune ones,<br/>
such as the chief dharma holder PrajÃ±Ä RaÅmi.<a href="#fn:72" id="fnref:72" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[72]</a><br/>
Furthermore, countless other fortunate beings<br/>
maintained the precious teachings in secluded practice.<br/>
By enacting the twofold purpose,<br/>
I upheld the teachings of the two treasures;<br/>
and when the reincarnation<br/>
of the Lord Refuge Guru was enthroned,<br/>
my heartâs suffering eased a bit.<br/>
Moreover, out of his kindness,<br/>
my Lord of Refuge, the wish-fulfilling jewel,<br/>
actually had regarded a miserable dog like me<br/>
as a âlion with a turquoise maneâ; and when I reflected on that,<br/>
the sadness in my mind never lifted.<br/>
When the all-illuminating sun arose,<br/>
I was reminded of the kÄya of my Lord of Refuge Wish-Fulfilling Jewel.<br/>
When its light dispelled the darkness in all directions,<br/>
I thought of his enlightened quality of impartial compassion.<br/>
From the upper expanse of the sky,<br/>
when the sun set behind the western mountains,<br/>
I recalled how my master himself came to guide all of us<br/>
and had now passed beyond suffering.<br/>
When I saw the vast expanse of the sky,<br/>
I remembered the appearance of his naturally arising,<br/>
spontaneously present rÅ«pakÄya<br/>
appearing from the expanse of the pure dharmakÄya, the ground of basic space.<br/>
In all symbols and signs and in everything that I saw and that appeared,<br/>
I recalled my Lord of Refuge Wish-Fulfilling Jewel.<br/>
Whatever solitary place or monastery I stayed in,<br/>
I missed my guru.<br/>
When I reflected on my practice and the oral instructions,<br/>
I missed my guru.<br/>
When I met with my noble dharma brothers and sisters,<br/>
I longed for my guru.<br/>
No matter what I felt,<br/>
I remembered my guru.<br/>
I thought only of my guide and teacher, Pema Ledrel.<br/>
Missing him so much,<br/>
I cried incessantly all the time.<br/>
Due to such intense sadness,<br/>
my thinking became muddled.<br/>
Although I had accompanied him for so long,<br/>
it felt like one instant.<br/>
I had received so many empowerments and teachings,<br/>
but now it seemed that they took place in one second.<br/>
When I thought of how everything happened in this way,<br/>
it broke my heart.<br/>
When I saw his face,<br/>
faith and devotion arose from the depth of my being.<br/>
Merely hearing his voice brought me<br/>
to the path of maturity and liberation.<br/>
The enlightened intent of his wisdom mind<br/>
opened the hundred doors of the secret treasury.<br/>
From him, a shower of dharma teachings rained down<br/>
in accordance with the mental dispositions and capabilities of beings,<br/>
liberating them from the narrow passageways of saá¹sÄra.<br/>
Having reached the supreme level of unsurpassed, constant exaltation,<br/>
he was the guide who liberated beings in the primordial expanse.<br/>
His kindness was unfathomable,<br/>
and I was without any way to repay him.<br/>
Reflecting on the implications of that<br/>
stirred up my grief-stricken mind even more;<br/>
and I fell into wailing, thinking of my sublime guru.<br/>
However, in order to repay his kindness,<br/>
I cast away such selfish thinking based on my own emotions.<br/>
I explained and spread the profound treasures to fortunate disciples.<br/>
I acted in harmony with the dharma<br/>
with all my actions of body, speech, and mind.<br/>
Like a rhinoceros, I kept to my practice in solitude.<a href="#fn:73" id="fnref:73" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[73]</a><br/>
Even though I had the authority [to reveal] my own treasures,<br/>
I felt myself unworthy of treasure activity.<br/>
âIf the child maintains the fatherâs lineage,<br/>
that is enough,â I thought.<br/>
It is said that the locations of my own profound treasures<br/>
 are the three places of enlightened body,<br/>
the three places of enlightened mind,<br/>
the three places of White Crag and Fortress,<br/>
and two hidden sacred places.<br/>
As for the profound teachings,<br/>
there are the trunk, branch, flower, and fruition cycles<br/>
and the unchanging treasures of enlightened mind, like the earth.<br/>
My supplementary enlightened activity treasures are inconceivable.<br/>
As for my treasure companions,<br/>
they are the two supreme and the three excellent ones,<br/>
the five great bodhisattvas belonging to the five families.<br/>
As for my dharma holders, there are four heart sons, eight supreme ones,<br/>
followed by twenty-five, and then one hundred and so on.<br/>
They will achieve the result of the two stages in one lifetime.<br/>
The time, indications, and auspicious circumstances<br/>
 of revealing my dharma treasures are indicated by the á¸ÄkinÄ«s<br/>
in the chapters of my treasure inventories, the inner prophetic guides,<br/>
the supplementary inventories, the appendices, and so on.<br/>
They predicted that my work of benefitting disciples<br/>
would spread in five locations, especially in the east and in the south. </p>
<p>In summary, I have put this brief collection of essential words<br/>
about my treasures into writing in the form of an autobiography,<br/>
as something of great meaning expressed with few words<br/>
that would fulfill the wishes of worthy disciples.<br/>
How could someone like me, of ordinary inferior birth,<br/>
have secret qualities of excellent speech?<br/>
In any case, through the compassion of the lineage gurus<br/>
and the ultimate ripening of the results of the two accumulations<br/>
over many lifetimes, I attained a birth endowed with dharma<br/>
and pleased the noble ones.<br/>
The holder of profound treasures, Pema Lingpa,<br/>
held me with his compassion;<br/>
and by his conferral of the ripening and liberating teachings,<br/>
my previous karma awakened along with the authority<br/>
to reveal some minor profound treasures.<br/>
From then onward, I had the ability of undeniable siddhis<br/>
[to reveal] profound treasures in several future lifetimes.<br/>
Although I had no intention to maintain a retinue of disciples:<br/>
because of my previous aspirations,<br/>
I cared for them with skillful means.<br/>
Lacking any significant secret qualities,<br/>
this account is merely an abridged version of how I have lived.<br/>
I have not written it for status<br/>
or for the eight worldly concerns.<br/>
In order not to break my promise to fortunate disciples,<br/>
I have put some nonsense into writing. </p>
<p>Through this virtue, may the lotus feet<br/>
of the dharma holders remain firm.<br/>
May outer and inner auspicious connections be perfected,<br/>
and merit increase.<br/>
May all decline of the dharma throughout the universe<br/>
and among the inhabitants be dispelled.<br/>
May the bad times of war and famine be pacified.<br/>
May the profound treasure teachings spread in the ten directions,<br/>
and the enlightened activities of the ones who uphold them increase.<br/>
May the sponsorsâ power and wealth spread and increase,<br/>
and may sentient beings attain happiness<br/>
and practice the fully endowed dharma.<br/>
May all beings be liberated in the Lotus Light Palace of Ngayab!<a href="#fn:74" id="fnref:74" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[74]</a>,<br/>
May they be welcomed by the vidyÄdharas, á¸Äkas, and á¸ÄkinÄ«s!<br/>
Singing the song of the Guru Siddhi [Mantra],<br/>
may we be reborn in the land of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s,<br/>
Oá¸á¸iyÄna, indivisible from Pema Drodul Lingpa;<br/>
and may teacher and disciple awaken inseparably<br/>
in his enlightened wisdom intent! </p>
<p>Thus, this is the story of a mendicantâs experiences. While it is difficult to say the name of the omniscient Lord of Refuge, I say it here for a purpose. </p>
<p>My two vajra brothers, sublime monks of ShÄkyamuni with minds free of conceptsâthe sky-like yogis Donli and Rangjung who were actual disciples of the great awareness holder and the Lord of Accomplished Ones, Gelek Palzangâboth earnestly requested me for a long time [to write this] with stainless offering scarves and silver. My own student, the vagabond Sherab Ãzer, who made supports for the three treasure lineages, stayed only in isolated hermitages and propagated the profound teachings however he could. In particular, he offered his body, speech, and mind to the lama and, having forsaken non-virtuous activity, always engaged in practice. He also persistently requested me [to write this]. </p>
<p>Furthermore, many faithful students such as Rigzang, Gyurme Trinle and others also earnestly requested me. In order not to ignore their profound requests, the lowliest of all the students of the omniscient lord, I, Kunzang Dekyong ChÃ¶nyi Wangmo wrote this in the Earth Snake Year (1929) in the ninth month on the excellent sixteenth day, from the isolated retreat place at Sera Monastery. My attendant, the monk Tsultrim Dorje, supplied the writing materials. </p>
<p>May this spread throughout all directions and times, and may everything be auspicious! May virtue prevail in the three times!</p>
<p>Geâo Geâo Geâo. Sarva Mangalam. </p>

<p>In the VajrayÄna tradition, a practitioner calls those who share the same lineage, those who receive empowerments and oral teachings together, and those who share the same guru âvajra brothers and sisters,â or âvajra kin.â <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>According to the Buddhist tradition, the dharmakÄyaâor absolute nature or truth bodyâcan be understood as the fundamental ground of enlightenment, which is described in terms of conceptual distinctions as containing the aspects of original purity and spontaneous presence. Within this ground, the primordial buddha, Samantabhadra, is enlightened by recognizing the true nature of reality just as it is, without ever having to stray into confusion as a sentient being. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The five buddha families are the families of Vairochana, Aká¹£hobhya, Ratnasambhava, AmitÄbha, and Amoghasiddhi. Vairochana is at the center when the five are depicted together. Glacial Lake (<em>gang chen tsho/gangs chen mtsho</em>) is an epithet for Vairochana and refers to the Buddhist cosmological presentation of existence as issuing forth from the scented water that flows from the bodies of these buddhas, manifesting the pure realms and all universes. This is what can be understood as the sambhogakÄya, or the enjoyment nature body, which is the wisdom manifestation of the primordial ground of enlightenment as buddhas, pure lands, and various wisdom appearances.

Padmasambhava, as well as others, predicted the individuals who would discover these teachings in the future. One such vajra prophecy regarding Sera Khandro is from the profound teaching of the great treasure revealer Pema Lingpa (<em>padma gling pa</em>) called <em>Concise Red Inventory</em> (<em>snying byang dmar po</em>) and is quoted by Khenpo Pema Ãsal Thaye, âIn the future, at a dharma place of the gods, an emanation of VajravÄrÄhÄ« with the name Bliss (bde ba), [will come] in the Water Dragon Year.

Sera Khandro gave birth to another son [i.e., Rigdzin Gyurme Dorje] in her late twenties and traveled with her two children between the nomadic encampments of Gara Gyalsey and Drime Ãzer numerous times before she went to live with Drime Ãzer permanently. <a href="#fnref:58" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Sera Khandro suffered much of her life from arthritis or gout. This condition worsened considerably in her late twenties; and by the time she made her final departure for Drime Ãzerâs encampment, she could not walk and had to be tied onto her horse. When arriving at Drime Ãzerâs encampment, she was almost dead. His healing ceremonies and their practice together revived her and averted this obstacle to her life. In her long autobiography she also recounts another time of intense illness when, in great sorrow over her weak health, Drime Ãzer cried a tear that landed in her ear and traveled to her heart, thereby reviving her. <a href="#fnref:59" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
